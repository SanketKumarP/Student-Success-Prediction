## Overview
This project focuses on predicting early student dropouts and at-risk students using advanced machine learning models on the Open University Learning Analytics Dataset (OULAD). By leveraging time series data and meta modeling approaches, our goal is to proactively identify students in need of support to improve educational outcomes.

## Dataset
**OULAD** - The Open University Learning Analytics Dataset, which includes:
- Demographics
- Assessment results
- Virtual Learning Environment (VLE) interaction data

---

## Key Features
- **Predictive Modeling**:  
  Developed machine learning models, including **Time Series Forest (TSF)**, **Random Forest (RF)**, and **XGBoost**, for high accuracy in predicting at-risk students.

- **Meta-Modeling**:  
  Combined demographic, behavioral, and assessment data to achieve superior performance metrics.

- **Class Imbalance Handling**:  
  Applied **SMOTE** to address data imbalance and improve model fairness.

- **Feature Engineering**:  
  - Time-series data extraction  
  - Clustering (K-Prototypes, K-Means) for better data segmentation  
  - Analysis of submission patterns and activity rates

---

## Tech Stack
- **Programming Language**: Python  
- **Tools & Platforms**:  
  - Google Colab  
  - VS Code  
- **Libraries Used**:  
  - `scikit-learn`, `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`  
  - `imbalanced-learn`, `xgboost`, `time-series-forest`

## Project Workflow
1. **Data Preprocessing**:  
   - Cleaned and transformed raw data  
   - Handled missing values and normalized features  

2. **Feature Engineering**:  
   - Extracted time-series features  
   - Clustering for behavioral segmentation  

3. **Model Training and Evaluation**:  
   - Built and fine-tuned ML models  
   - Evaluated using AUC, Recall, Accuracy  

4. **Insights Generation**:  
   - Identified trends influencing student success
